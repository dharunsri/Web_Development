                Let's get to know something about Steve Jobs</h2>

            <div class="information">
                    <h4 style="color: beige; text-align: center;" id="name"><b>Steve Jobs</b>
                        <p id="para">
                            Steve Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California on February 24, 1955. 
                            His birth parents gave him up for adoption and he was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. 
                            Paul was a machinist and Clara an accountant. 
                            When Steve was five, the family moved to Mountain View, California where Steve went to school and grew up. 
                            One of Steve's favorite hobbies growing up was working with electronics in his garage with his dad. 
                            They would take apart electronics like radios and then put them back together. 
                            Steve was a smart student, but got bored with school. <br><br>
                            He often played pranks on others, getting into trouble. When he was thirteen, Jobs met eighteen-year-old Steve Wozniak. 
                            Wozniak was also into electronics and the two boys became friends.
                            After graduating from high school, Jobs attended Reed College in Oregon. 
                            However, he found the classes boring and soon dropped out, taking a job with video game maker Atari. 
                            Jobs became more and more interested in philosophy. He quit his job and took a trip to India to find "enlightenment." 
                            He spent seven months traveling around India and studying the religion of Zen Buddhism. 
                            Upon his return to California, he went back to work for Atari.<br><br>
                            Jobs began hanging out with Steve Wozniak again and the two of them were very interested in computers. 
                            Wozniak wanted his own personal computer and, being the electronics genius he was, he invented his own computer. 
                            Jobs was impressed. He said they should start their own company selling the computer and Wozniak agreed. 
                            In 1976, they formed the company Apple Computer and called their first computer the Apple I. 
                            They began making the computers in Jobs' garage. Jobs was just 21 years old at the time. 
                            Wozniak then started working on the next version called the Apple II. Jobs could tell that this was going to be a great product. 
                            He sold the idea to some investors convincing them to invest in the company. The Apple II was a great success. 
                            The company quickly grew and went public just four years after it started in 1980<br><br>
